Your explanation should be clear and concise.\nOkay, so I have this problem where a user is encountering an error when running their Python code. The error message says that the program can't find a video file. The specific error is about a file path being incorrect or invalid. Let me try to figure out what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the error details. The message says it's trying to run the function and fails because the program can't find the video file. The specific message is \"Error: 비디오를 열 수 없습니다. (D:\\\\pose_prediction\\\\data_agent\\\\data\\u000bideo\\\\Effective Boxing Combos To Drill.mp4)\". So it's trying to access an mp4 file located at that path, but the system can't find it. \n\nHmm, the user is probably using a script that's supposed to handle video files, but the path is incorrect. Maybe the path is wrong, or perhaps the script is using a different file format that's not supported. For example, if the script expects a.avi file but the path points to a",
